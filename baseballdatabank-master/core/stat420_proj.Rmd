## A tentative title for the project

Statistical Approach of Predicting MLB Baseball Team Success

## Dataset

### Source: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

### Description: MLB data. Some data manipulation will be done to get desired data format  [readme2014.txt](http:readme2014.txt)

### Analysis Ideas:

#### Find out which predictors are useful for predicting rank or winning the Championship - % Salaries, Win, Loss, ... etc

##### Potential Response Variables

- Rank           Position in final standings
- WSWin          World Series Winner (Y or N)
- LgWin          League Champion(Y or N)

##### Selected Predictor Variables
- yearID         Year
- W              Wins
- L              Losses
- salary         Total Salary of the team
- totalSalary    Total Salary of all teams in that year
- pctSalary      Total Salary of the team as a proportion of the total salary of all teams in that year

A description of the dataset. You do not necessarily have to list all the variables, but at least mention those of greatest importance.
Background information on the dataset, including specific citation of its source.
A brief statement of the business, science, research, or personal interest you have in the dataset that you hope to explore.
Evidence that the data can be loaded into R. Load the data, and print the first few values of the response variable as evidence.

```{r}
teams <- read.csv("Teams.csv")
salaries <- read.csv("Salaries.csv")
salries_by_team_year = aggregate(x=salaries$salary, by = list(salaries$teamID, salaries$yearID), FUN=sum)
colnames(salries_by_team_year) = c("teamID", "yearID", "salary")

mlb_data = merge(teams, salries_by_team_year, by=c("yearID", "teamID") )
mlb_data$salary = as.numeric(mlb_data$salary)

total_salary_by_year = aggregate(mlb_data$salary, by = list(mlb_data$yearID), FUN=sum)
colnames(total_salary_by_year) = c("yearID", "totalSalary")

mlb_data = merge(mlb_data, total_salary_by_year, by = c("yearID"))
mlb_data$pctSalary = mlb_data$salary / mlb_data$totalSalary
head(mlb_data)
```
